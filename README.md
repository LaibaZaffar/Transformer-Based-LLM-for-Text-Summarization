## Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of a text summarizer using **Python** and popular natural language processing (NLP) frameworks. The project leverages pre-trained transformer models from the Hugging Face library to perform extractive or abstractive summarization of textual data.

## Features
- **Abstractive Summarization**: Generates a concise summary by rephrasing the input text while retaining its meaning.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows configuration of summarization parameters such as maximum summary length.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: Offers a step-by-step implementation in Jupyter Notebook for ease of understanding and replication.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following:
- Python 3.8 or later
- Jupyter Notebook/VS Code/Google Colab
- Required Python libraries:
  - transformers
  - torch
  - sentencepiece
  - pandas (optional, for text input/output management)
  - nltk (optional, for preprocessing)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LaibaZaffar/Transformer-Based-LLM-for-Text-Summarization.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Transformer-Based-LLM-for-Text-Summarization
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies/libraries as mentioned in first cell of the notebook.

## Notes
- Large Language Models (LLMs) require significant memory for both training and testing. It is recommended to run the project in Google Colab or a system with sufficient resources.
- For large input texts, ensure that you adjust the token limits to avoid errors.

## File Structure
- `Text Summarizer.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation.
- `samsum-test.csv`: Test Dataset file containing text and corresponding summaries.
- `samsum-train.csv`: Train Dataset file containing text and corresponding summaries.
- `samsum-validation.csv`: Validation Dataset file containing text and corresponding summaries.

## Acknowledgements
